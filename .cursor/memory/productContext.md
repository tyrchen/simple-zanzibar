# Product Context: Simplified Rust Zanzibar

The product is a simplified Rust implementation of Google's Zanzibar authorization system. It is designed for local development, testing, and small-scale applications that require a powerful and flexible access control model but do not need a globally distributed infrastructure. The system allows developers to define fine-grained permissions using a DSL inspired by Zanzibar's configuration language. Core features include checking for permissions (`check` API) and discovering who has access (`expand` API).
